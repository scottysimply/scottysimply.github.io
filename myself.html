        <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">My name is Scott, I'm a freshman at Ozarks Technical College. This first semester really taught me a lot about how the real world works (I'm only 18!), what to expect in more professional settings (such as through Web Development I's client project), and how to apply myself better.</p>
        <p class="below-title">I'm a full time student since I'm apparently not great at finding jobs. The highlights for next semester will likely be Web Development II (Javascript), Systems Analysis, and C# I. My other two classes, Public Speaking and Contemporary Math, both seem to be things I won't like, but for opposite reasons. I'm not looking forward to Public Speaking since I hate talking in front of others. As for the math, I love math, I took Calculus I in high school. I'm only taking the course so I get a small break in difficulty, but it's still going to be a little boring due to that.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="heading">Personal Projects</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">While studying at OTC, I've done a lot of personal projects. Most of them were short and only spanned a week at most, however there is one that I have been working on for almost a year, even before I took classes here. I'll order these in what I consider to be importance:</p>
            <dl class="personal-projects">
                <dt>Deep Rock Galactic Items</dt>
                <dd>This is a Terraria mod that I've been working on since January 2023. Terraria is a game written in C#, using Microsoft XNA Framework. The mod doesn't have a lot of features, especially now that I'm busy with school, however this is how I taught myself C#. It is available from <a class="text-link" href="http://github.com/scottysimply/deeprockitems" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> Github</a> or <a class="text-link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3042354198" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-steam"></i> Steam</a>, however the Github link touts the source code.</dd>
    
                <dt>Connect Four in MonoGame</dt>
                <dd>This is a project I started working on in Intro to Computer Science and finished in roughly a week. MonoGame is an extension of Microsoft XNA Framework, as XNA was officially discontinued in 2014. 3 games that I enjoy all come from XNA or Monogame, so I enjoy working with those libraries. The actual game I made was basic, however it fully functions and is available on <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/scottysimply/CIS-120/tree/main/ConnectFour" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> Github</a>. I want to dip my toes into making a bot to play against, but that would be very difficult and time consuming. I'll save that for outside of school ;)</dd>
    
                <dt>Giant's Deep Clock</dt>
                <dd>This is how I've used ECMAScript-related languages before. There is an application called Wallpaper Engine that allows for the creation and distribution of live wallpapers, and HTML/CSS/JS wallpapers. The wallpaper is based on the game Outer Wilds, and required me to make custom circular path logic using a wallpaper equivalent of Javascript. The wallpaper is available for download on <a class="text-link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3103748318" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-steam"></i> Steam</a> assuming you have Wallpaper Engine ($5.99).</dd>
    
                <dt>Stardew Valley Crop Calculator</dt>
                <dd>This is just a spreadsheet that calculates the daily currency per day of some crops in the game Stardew Valley. There's two hotly contested choices for the best crop: Ancient Fruit, or Starfruit. Ancient Fruit regrows on its own and is harvested every 7 days, but takes 1 month to initially grow and sells for less. Starfruit takes 13 days to grow, but sells for more and needs to be replanted after harvesting. With the calculations I made, Ancient Fruit is the better choice.</dd>
