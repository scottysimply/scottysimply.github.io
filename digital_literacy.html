        <h1 class="title">Digital Literacy</h1>
        <p class="below-title">This was the first course of the day for me. It wasn't the most exciting (I did take the MOS-Specialist course in high school), but it was nice to freshen up on things I've already done.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">Word</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">This unit involved making and modifying Word documents. It's very reminiscent of CSS styling, to be honest. I made some flyers, made some more flyers. Looking back, we really made a lot of flyers in this unit. This unit also covered most of the first semester.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="heading">Powerpoint</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">Powerpoint was the shortest unit, however I got to showcase some of my personal projects due to the projects during this unit. I absolutely love bragging about myself, so of course a unit where I get to talk about myself, I'm going to enjoy.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Powerpoint is probably my least used (and perhaps least favorite) Office app, out of the main 3. However, the ability to create shapes makes Powerpoint surprisingly excellent for wireframing websites. The only problem is, I hate using apps to wireframe. It is much more fluid (to me) to wireframe with pen/paper, or when I remember to charge my tablet, that.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="heading">Excel</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">I'm definitely a numbers guy, and that leads Excel to being my favorite Office app. Data entry isn't exactly the most enjoyable thing, but I always love crunching numbers. I'll just namedrop one of my personal endeavors: I play a farming game called Stardew Valley, and there is a hot debate over which crop is statistically better to grow.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">With the magic of Excel to do the work for me, I calclulated that one of them was by far the best crop, and one of the commonly-used strategies (aging your produce) is actually not worth it.</p>
