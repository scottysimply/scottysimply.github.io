        <h1 class="title">Intro to Programming</h1>
        <p class="below-title">I can't exactly say that I learned a lot in this class. I have a fairly decent amount of experience with programming & C#, however I set my personal goals in this class to push myself much farther than I've done before.</p>
    
        <h2 class="heading">Course Structure</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">In this class, it was mostly lecture and solo work time with C# or MakeCode. Due to this, I often had a lot of free time (I stuck around in class because I liked the teacher), and I used this as an opportunity to push myself to learn more about the language I so call home.</p>
    
        <h2 class="heading">MonoGame</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">MonoGame is an extension of an outdated video-game framework called Microsoft XNA Framework. Since it's mostly just a collection of rendering & input libraries, it was discontinued in 2014. However, I find it a treat to work with.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Previously, I'd used it to create a 2D game engine (that I promptly did nothing with). However, I used it at the forefront of 2 of my projects in the class. One of the projects involved me in a group, so I had to teach my partner (who just started C#) the basis of that language. This was potentially my favorite experience coding, ever.</p>
