            <p class="body-text">It wouldn't be a website by me if I don't get to shill my personal projects! Terraria is a game created by Re-Logic in 2011. The game was created in Microsoft XNA Framework, which makes it very easy and popular to create modifications for. This was the perfect entry point for me to learn C#. I've created 1 mod so far, however it is rapidly approaching a proper release. While working on this mod, I've had a lot of ideas for other mods. I especially want to work on mods for people who require accessibility features, such as a colorblind mode, automatic weapon aiming, and more.</p>

            <h3 class="section-header">Deep Rock Galactic Items</h3>
            <p class="body-text">I love the game Deep Rock Galactic. It's a 4-player, player vs enemy shooter. To allow a sense of progression, weapons are upgraded to increase or modify the weapon's stats, such as damage, fire rate, etc. My mod brings 5 weapons from Deep Rock Galactic into Terraria, along with an upgrade system to ensure that weapons remain viable throughout many stages of the game. My most recent change to the mod was a yellow glow around upgrades that can be equipped on the 
            currently selected weapon. In order to do this, I had to directly edit the Microsoft Intermediate Langauge, C#'s mirror of assembly.</p>
